            <p>Commercial boats and ferries contribute to water pollution through emissions, fuel and oil spills, ballast water discharge, sewage and waste discharge, and the use of anti-fouling paints. </p>
            <p>These activities can harm marine ecosystems, introduce invasive species, and contribute to marine litter. Efforts to mitigate pollution include regulations, cleaner technologies, and improved waste management practices, but ongoing action is needed to protect marine environments..</p>
