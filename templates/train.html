        <h2>The Environmental Impact of Trains</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Air pollution </li>
            <p>Trains, pivotal in transportation, also pose environmental challenges. Diesel locomotives emit pollutants, compromising air quality and public health. <p>
            <p>Railway construction disrupts ecosystems and consumes resources. Furthermore, transporting goods risks spills, endangering local environments. <p>
            <li>How do rail construction affect</li>
            <p>Rail construction impacts the environment through habitat destruction and resource consumption. Clearing land for tracks disrupts ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity. Additionally, the production of materials like steel and concrete for railways contributes to carbon emissions and resource depletion. <p>
